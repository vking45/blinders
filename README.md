# Blinders - A Solana Grizzlython Project

A Solana Betting Platform

### What Sets Us Apart ?
A Truly On-Chain P2P Betting Platform. All The Funds Are Managed In A Complete Trustless Way On-Chain. DAO Will Add New Matches And Update The Match States Thus Providing Decentralization To The Whole Experience.
<br /> We Are Still Building The DAO, More Updates Coming Soon. <br />
We Are Using The Chips Model, Wherein Users Will Have To Exchange SOL For Blinders Tokens Which Will Be Used For Betting. We Aim To Generate Profit That Will Be Needed To Sustain The Platform Using Our Token Model And Token Exchange Rates.
